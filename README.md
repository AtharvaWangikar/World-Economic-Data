# World-Economic-Data Analysis
Creating Data Visualization and Dashboards to better understand the Global Economic scenario: We will develop interactive and visually engaging dashboards presenting key economic indicators, trends, and forecasts. Now, any organization can use this data and forecasts for data-driven decision-making. Many organizations nowadays, require insights on how to diversify their portfolio, and our visualizations and dashboards aim to solve this very problem. From the huge amount of data available, we will be able to understand problems faced by various developing and developed nations and we would be able to devise for more sustainable development. We will be focusing on a set of critical metrics such as Corruption, Standard of living, GDP per capita, Unemployment, etc. We will be able to utilize data visualization tools such as IBM Cognos to create charts, graphs, and maps that make it easier for decision-makers to grasp complex economic insights at a glance.

# Novelty / Uniqueness:
Our solution is exceptional because it not only analyses the given data but also uses modern tools to predict and identify common trends, to, give a more detailed summary of the Economic milieu. Unlike the various solutions already out there, our project will focus on some of the more esoteric aspects of the economy such as debt ratio, inflation, and tourism. These topics allow us to look at the Economic data from a unique perspective. We wish to generate insights on correlations and policy impact changes around the world. Most of the solutions in the market focus on the univariate time series analysis, while, we aim to provide a more 3-dimensional approach. We also aim to assess and mitigate any risks associated with the Global Economy. We would like to work on long-term trend Analysis and assessment of competitive advantages and weaknesses across regions and industries.

# Business / Social Impact:
This solution will help businesses understand economic opportunities better.
The organized compilation could be used for Education and Research purposes. 
It will allow us to identify regions or demographics facing economic challenges and propose poverty alleviation and financial inclusion programs.
It aims to influence businesses, government policies, social well-being, and global collaboration.
